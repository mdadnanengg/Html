    <h1> <u> Eknath Shinde takes charge as Maharashtra CM at Mantralaya </u> </h1>
    <p> <b>Maharashtra Chief Minister Eknath Shinde </b> officially took charge of his post at the State secretariat
        Mantralaya
        on Thursday.</p>

    <p> A puja was held at the tastefully decorated office of the Chief Minister before <strong>Mr. Shinde </strong>took
        charge. His
        chamber had a large photograph of Shiv Sena founder Bal Thackeray and a picture of Mr. Shinde's mentor Anand
        Dighe next to it.</p>

    <p>As soon as he entered the secretariat building, Mr. Shinde paid floral tributes to Maratha warrior king
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Dr. B.R. Ambedkar
        </li>
        <li>
            Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj
        </li>
    </ol>


    <p>
        Speaking to reporters, Deepak Kesarkar, spokesperson of the Shinde-led faction of MLAs, said <mark> Bal
            Thackeray </mark> was
        nobody's property.
    </p>

    <p>"Balasaheb belongs to the entire State and nobody can change this fact," he said, when asked about the Uddhav
        Thackeray-led faction's objection to the use of the late Sena founder's name and photograph by the Shinde group.
    </p>

    <p>

        Targeting Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut, Mr. Kesarkar said, "Mr. Raut is closer to <em> Sharad Pawar </em> I don't
        know about
        Uddhavji. When I realised that the Shiv Sena is facing problems in the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA- comprising the
        Sena, NCP and Congress), I tried to convince Uddhavji. I have never met him for a ministerial post." "In 2014,
        he had told me he was unable to make me a Cabinet Minister because he had to give first priority to Sena leaders
        who had worked with Balasaheb. That is why I respect Uddhavji," he said.
    </p>

    <p> Mr. Kesarkar also criticised the Uddhav Thackeray-led Shiv Sena's decision to replace Bhavana Gawali as the
        party's chief whip in the Lok Sabha.</p>

    <p>"With such an action, you are insulting women. She is a five-time MP, who has held the Shiv Sena flag high," he
        said.

        The Uddhav Thackeray-led faction on Wednesday nominated Rajan Vichare as the party's chief whip in the Lok
        Sabha, replacing Gawali.</p>
