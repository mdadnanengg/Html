        <h1 style="color:blueviolet;">MERN Stack Explained</h1>
        <p><b> MERN </b> is one of several variations of the <strong> MEAN stack (MongoDB Express Angular Node)
            </strong>
            where the
            traditional
            Angular.js front-end framework is replaced with React.js. Other variants include MEVN (MongoDB, Express,
            Vue,
            Node), and really any front-end JavaScript framework can work.</p>

        <h3 style="color:blueviolet;">What is the MERN stack?</h3>
        <p><i>MERN stands for MongoDB, Express, React, Node, after the four key technologies that make up the stack.</i>
        </p>

        <ul id="abc">
            <li>
                MongoDB — document database
            </li>
            <li>
                Express(.js) — Node.js web framework
            </li>
            <li>
                React(.js) — a client-side JavaScript framework
            </li>
            <li>
                Node(.js) — the premier JavaScript web server
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>Express and Node make up the middle (application) tier. Express.js is a server-side web framework, and
            Node.js is
            the popular and powerful JavaScript server platform. Regardless of which variant you choose, ME(RVA)N is the
            ideal approach to working with JavaScript and JSON, all the way through.</p>
    </div>


    <div class="xyz">
        <h3 style="color:blueviolet;">How does the MERN stack work?</h3>
        <p><em>The MERN architecture allows you to easily construct a three-tier architecture (front end, back end,
                database)
                entirely using JavaScript and JSON.</em></p>

            width="600" alt="MERN stack work">
    </div>

    <div class="xyz">
        <h3 style="color:blueviolet;">React.js front end</h3>
        <p>The top tier of the MERN stack is React.js, the declarative JavaScript framework for creating dynamic
            client-side
            applications in HTML. React lets you build up complex interfaces through simple components, connect them to
            data
            on your back-end server, and render them as HTML.</p>
        <p>React’s strong suit is handling stateful, data-driven interfaces with minimal code and minimal pain, and it
            has
            all the bells and whistles you’d expect from a modern web framework: great support for forms, error
            handling,
            events, lists, and more.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="xyz">
        <h3 style="color:blueviolet;">Express.js and Node.js server tier</h3>
        <p>The next level down is the Express.js server-side framework, running inside a Node.js server. Express.js
            bills
            itself as a “fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js,” and that is indeed exactly what it
            is.
            Express.js has powerful models for URL routing (matching an incoming URL with a server function), and
            handling
            HTTP requests and responses.</p>
        <p>By making XML HTTP Requests (XHRs) or GETs or POSTs from your React.js front end, you can connect to
            Express.js
            functions that power your application. Those functions, in turn, use MongoDB’s Node.js drivers, either via
            callbacks or using promises, to access and update data in your MongoDB database.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="xyz">
        <h3 style="color:blueviolet;">MongoDB database tier</h3>
        <p>If your application stores any data (user profiles, content, comments, uploads, events, etc.), then you’re
            going
            to want a database that’s just as easy to work with as React, Express, and Node.
        </p>
        <p>That’s where MongoDB comes in: JSON documents created in your React.js front end can be sent to the
            Express.js
            server, where they can be processed and (assuming they’re valid) stored directly in MongoDB for later
            retrieval.
            Again, if you’re building in the cloud, you’ll want to look at Atlas. If you’re looking to set up your own
            MERN stack, read on!
        </p>
    </div>

<div class="xyz">
    <h3 style="color:blueviolet;">Is MERN a full-stack solution?</h3>
    <p>Yes, MERN is a full stack, following the traditional three-tier architectural pattern, including the front-end
        display tier (React.js), application tier (Express.js and Node.js), and database tier (MongoDB).</p>
</div>

    <div class="xyz">
        <h3 style="color:blueviolet;">Why choose the MERN stack?</h3>
    <p>Let’s start with MongoDB, the document database at the root of the MERN stack. MongoDB was designed to store JSON
        data natively (it technically uses a binary version of JSON called BSON), and everything from its command line
        interface to its query language (MQL, or MongoDB Query Language) is built on JSON and JavaScript.</p>
    <p>MongoDB works extremely well with Node.js, and makes storing, manipulating, and representing JSON data at every
        tier of your application incredibly easy. For cloud-native applications, MongoDB Atlas makes it even easier, by
        giving you an auto-scaling MongoDB cluster on the cloud provider of your choice, as easy as a few button clicks.
    </p>
    <p>Express.js (running on Node.js) and React.js make the JavaScript/JSON application MERN full stack, well, full.
        Express.js is a server-side application framework that wraps HTTP requests and responses, and makes it easy to
        map URLs to server-side functions. React.js is a front end JavaScript framework for building interactive user
        interfaces in HTML, and communicating with a remote server.</p>
    <p>The combination means that JSON data flows naturally from front to back, making it fast to build on and
        reasonably simple to debug. Plus, you only have to know one programming language, and the JSON document
        structure, to understand the whole system!</p>
    <p>MERN is the stack of choice for today’s web developers looking to move quickly, particularly for those with
        React.js experience.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="xyz">
        <h3><mark> <span style="color:blueviolet;"> MERN use cases </span></mark> </h3>
    <p> <u> Like any web stack, you can build whatever you want in MERN — though it’s ideally suited for cases that are
            JSON-heavy, cloud-native, and that have dynamic web interfaces. </u></p>
    <p>Examples include workflow management, news aggregation, to-do apps and calendars, and interactive forums/social
        products — and whatever else you can dream up!</p>
